# Changelog

All notable changes to Kodiqa are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).

## [3.4.3] - 2026-06-06

### Changed
- The startup model update + new-model check now runs on **every launch by default** again (`update_check_interval_hours` default 24 → 0), restoring the pre-3.4.0 behavior — while keeping all the 3.4.0 fixes. The throttle is still available (set `update_check_interval_hours` > 0), `--no-update` still skips, and `/update` still forces a check.

## [3.4.2] - 2026-06-06

### Added
- `/update` — force a model update + new-model discovery check on demand, bypassing the 24h startup throttle added in 3.4.0 (does not reprint the welcome banner).

## [3.4.1] - 2026-06-06

### Fixed
- `/model` picker now lists the models actually installed in Ollama (with their friendly alias, e.g. `/coder`) instead of the static `MODEL_ALIASES` list — so deleted models no longer appear. Falls back to the alias list if Ollama is unreachable, and shows a hint when no local models are installed. Now consistent with `/models`.

## [3.4.0] - 2026-06-06

### Fixed
- **Auto-compact death spiral**: `_estimate_tokens` used the cumulative lifetime input-token sum, so after enough turns auto-compact fired on *every* message, repeatedly nuking the conversation. Now tracks the most recent request's prompt size and resets after compaction.
- **Command injection in `git_diff`**: the auto-approved `git_diff` tool interpolated args into a `shell=True` string (RCE via prompt injection). Now runs `git diff` via argv with `shlex`, no shell.
- **`/team` crashed with `NameError`**: `re` was used in `team_worker` but never imported at module level. Added top-level `import re`.
- **Unbounded agentic loops**: `max_iterations` was defined but never enforced; all three chat loops were `while True:`. Now capped (default 15, configurable).
- **API keys world-readable**: `~/.kodiqa/settings.json` is now written with `0600` perms (dir `0700`).

### Changed
- **Startup is no longer blocking**: the model update/discovery check (which ran `ollama pull` on every installed model + scraped ollama.com on every launch) is now throttled to once per `update_check_interval_hours` (default 24) and skippable via `--no-update` or `check_updates: false` config.

### Added
- `--no-update` CLI flag; `check_updates` / `update_check_interval_hours` config options.
- `ruff` linting (pyflakes rules) + a CI lint step; removed dead code and unused imports across the codebase.
- Regression tests for the git_diff-injection and auto-compact fixes (290 tests total).

## [3.3.9] - 2026-06-06

### Added
- `/pull <model>` — download an Ollama model on demand (previously only possible at startup)
- `/delete [model]` (alias `/rm`) — delete locally downloaded Ollama models to free disk; interactive picker with sizes when no arg, exact/fuzzy match or `all` otherwise, always confirms before removing, warns when deleting the active model, tab-completes installed model names

## [3.3.8] - 2026-06-06

### Fixed
- Model discovery cache now invalidated on API key/region change (`/key`) — `/models` re-fetches live instead of serving a stale 10-minute cache, so newly-available provider models appear immediately
- Ollama update check no longer reports false "updated!" — compares model digest before/after `ollama pull` instead of matching an "up to date" string modern Ollama never prints (it prints "success" either way)

### Changed
- New-models list relabeled to "Top N new models available (most popular on ollama.com/library)" so the count isn't mistaken for the full catalog
- Raised the new-models display cap from 20 to 100

## [3.3.4] - 2026-03-05

### Fixed
- ask_user input visibility: switched from raw `input()` to Rich `Prompt.ask` so typed text is visible
- Batch edit review: added "Accept all, don't ask again" option to disable review for the session

## [3.3.1] - 2026-03-03

### Fixed
- Qwen model list: removed duplicates, removed models not in Coding Plan (qwq-plus, qwen3.5-flash, qwen-turbo, qwen-math-plus)
- Added missing Coding Plan models: glm-4.7, MiniMax-M2.5
- Model pull prompt: single-letter input no longer accidentally matches model names

### Added
