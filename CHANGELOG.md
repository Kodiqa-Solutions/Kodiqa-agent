# Changelog

All notable changes to Kodiqa are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).

## [3.7.1] - 2026-06-06

Internal refactor — no user-facing behavior change (only `/help` has a nicer grouped layout).

### Changed
- **Command dispatch is now a registry.** The ~850-line `if/elif` chain in `_handle_slash` is replaced by an 18-line dispatcher over a `_COMMAND_HANDLERS` table; each of the 73 commands is its own `_cmd_*` method. A single `_COMMAND_SPECS` registry (name, aliases, handler, group, args, description) is the source of truth — the dispatch table, the tab-completion list (`_SLASH_COMMANDS`), and `/help` all derive from it, so they can no longer drift out of sync. Adding a command is now two steps (a method + one registry row).

### Tests
- Added `TestCommandRegistry` integrity tests (every handler resolves to a real method, lists derive correctly, dispatch routes and passes args, user-alias expansion). 326 total.

## [3.7.0] - 2026-06-06

Quick-win batch — session resume, redo, live cost ticker, diffstat, and a friendlier first run.

### Added
- **`kodiqa -c` / `--continue`** — resume the most recent session immediately, skipping the y/n prompt.
- **`--resume [ID]`** — resume a specific saved history session by id (most recent when no id is given), mirroring `/history resume`.
- **`/redo`** — re-apply the most recently undone edit. A per-file redo stack sits alongside `/undo`; any fresh edit invalidates the redo stack (standard undo/redo semantics).
- **Live cost/token ticker** — while a response streams, the code/thinking status line now shows an estimated `~N tok ~$X` (output cost reconciled from real usage at end of turn). Hidden for local/free models.
- **End-of-turn diffstat** — after each turn, a `✎ N files changed, +x −y` rollup (per-file breakdown when more than one file changed), tracked across all permission modes.
- **First-run provider picker** — first launch now offers all 7 providers (Claude + OpenAI/DeepSeek/Groq/Mistral/Qwen + local-only) via the arrow-key selector, instead of hardcoding Claude. Sets the chosen provider's default model.

### Changed
- **Friendlier API errors** — connection failures and timeouts now print an actionable hint (check connection / `/model` to switch) instead of a raw exception; the Ollama connection error suggests `ollama serve`.

### Tests
- Added regressions for redo (round-trip, redo-clears-on-fresh-edit, new-file re-delete), the change-log/diffstat rollup, the live ticker, and `--resume` history loading (317 total).

## [3.6.0] - 2026-06-06

Medium-tier audit fixes (cross-platform, correctness, stability, security).

### Fixed
- **OpenAI o-series (o3/o3-mini/o4-mini) errored** — now send `max_completion_tokens` instead of `max_tokens` (the o-series reject the latter with a 400).
- **`OLLAMA_BIN` was macOS-only** — now resolved via `$OLLAMA_BIN` → `PATH` (`shutil.which`) → the macOS app bundle, so `/pull`, `/delete`, and update checks work on Linux/Windows.
- **`multi_edit` failed in Ollama text mode** — `edits` arriving as a JSON string is now parsed. Also no longer consumes an undo slot on a no-op.
- **`_stop_ollama` killed all Ollama processes** (`pkill -f ollama`) — now stops only the process Kodiqa started, and reaps it. Added an `atexit` handler that cleans up spawned MCP/LSP/Ollama children even on crash.
- **`memory_search` could fail under parallel dispatch** — SQLite connection now opened with `check_same_thread=False` (it's used from the tool thread pool).
- **Streaming connection leak** — all three chat loops now `resp.close()` in `finally`, not just on interrupt.

### Security
- **Hook command injection** — hook `{param}` values are now `shlex.quote`d before substitution, so a model-controlled value can't inject shell commands.
- **Blocklist hardening** — `run_command` now normalizes whitespace before matching `BLOCKED_COMMANDS`, so `rm  -rf  /` (extra spaces) is caught.

### Tests
- Added regressions for o-series body, multi_edit JSON-string input, and blocklist normalization (300 total).

## [3.5.0] - 2026-06-06

High-severity fixes from the 2026-06-06 audit (security + data-loss).

### Fixed
- **Workspace boundary bypass on multi-tool turns** — `execute_tools_parallel` skipped `_check_workspace_boundary`, so a model emitting 2+ tool calls could write/delete outside the workspace unprompted. The boundary check now runs on every tool (single and parallel), and uses `realpath` so symlinks can't escape.
- **Cost/budget reported $0 for current models** — `COST_TABLE` lacked the current alias targets (`claude-sonnet-4-6`, `claude-opus-4-6`, …). Added them; budget now tracks real spend.
- **Sessions lost assistant messages on save/restore** — `_save_session` kept only string-content messages, dropping Claude content-block turns and orphaning OpenAI tool messages (400 on restore). Now saves full history, trimming only a trailing unresolved tool call.
- **SSRF in `web_fetch`** — now validates URLs (http/https only) and rejects internal/loopback/link-local/cloud-metadata hosts, re-checking every redirect hop.
- **MCP stdio deadlock** — server stderr is now `DEVNULL` (an undrained pipe deadlocked at ~64KB) and reads have a 30s timeout so a hung server can't block Kodiqa; killed servers are now reaped.
- **Batch-edit queue clobbered same-file edits** — two queued edits to one file now compose on the latest queued state instead of both snapshotting the original (only the last edit used to survive).

### Tests
- Added regression tests for SSRF, the batch-edit clobber, and the cost table (295 total).

## [3.4.3] - 2026-06-06

### Changed
- The startup model update + new-model check now runs on **every launch by default** again (`update_check_interval_hours` default 24 → 0), restoring the pre-3.4.0 behavior — while keeping all the 3.4.0 fixes. The throttle is still available (set `update_check_interval_hours` > 0), `--no-update` still skips, and `/update` still forces a check.

## [3.4.2] - 2026-06-06

### Added
- `/update` — force a model update + new-model discovery check on demand, bypassing the 24h startup throttle added in 3.4.0 (does not reprint the welcome banner).

## [3.4.1] - 2026-06-06

### Fixed
- `/model` picker now lists the models actually installed in Ollama (with their friendly alias, e.g. `/coder`) instead of the static `MODEL_ALIASES` list — so deleted models no longer appear. Falls back to the alias list if Ollama is unreachable, and shows a hint when no local models are installed. Now consistent with `/models`.

## [3.4.0] - 2026-06-06

### Fixed
- **Auto-compact death spiral**: `_estimate_tokens` used the cumulative lifetime input-token sum, so after enough turns auto-compact fired on *every* message, repeatedly nuking the conversation. Now tracks the most recent request's prompt size and resets after compaction.
- **Command injection in `git_diff`**: the auto-approved `git_diff` tool interpolated args into a `shell=True` string (RCE via prompt injection). Now runs `git diff` via argv with `shlex`, no shell.
- **`/team` crashed with `NameError`**: `re` was used in `team_worker` but never imported at module level. Added top-level `import re`.
- **Unbounded agentic loops**: `max_iterations` was defined but never enforced; all three chat loops were `while True:`. Now capped (default 15, configurable).
- **API keys world-readable**: `~/.kodiqa/settings.json` is now written with `0600` perms (dir `0700`).

### Changed
- **Startup is no longer blocking**: the model update/discovery check (which ran `ollama pull` on every installed model + scraped ollama.com on every launch) is now throttled to once per `update_check_interval_hours` (default 24) and skippable via `--no-update` or `check_updates: false` config.

### Added
- `--no-update` CLI flag; `check_updates` / `update_check_interval_hours` config options.
- `ruff` linting (pyflakes rules) + a CI lint step; removed dead code and unused imports across the codebase.
- Regression tests for the git_diff-injection and auto-compact fixes (290 tests total).

## [3.3.9] - 2026-06-06

### Added
- `/pull <model>` — download an Ollama model on demand (previously only possible at startup)
- `/delete [model]` (alias `/rm`) — delete locally downloaded Ollama models to free disk; interactive picker with sizes when no arg, exact/fuzzy match or `all` otherwise, always confirms before removing, warns when deleting the active model, tab-completes installed model names

## [3.3.8] - 2026-06-06

### Fixed
- Model discovery cache now invalidated on API key/region change (`/key`) — `/models` re-fetches live instead of serving a stale 10-minute cache, so newly-available provider models appear immediately
- Ollama update check no longer reports false "updated!" — compares model digest before/after `ollama pull` instead of matching an "up to date" string modern Ollama never prints (it prints "success" either way)

### Changed
- New-models list relabeled to "Top N new models available (most popular on ollama.com/library)" so the count isn't mistaken for the full catalog
- Raised the new-models display cap from 20 to 100

## [3.3.4] - 2026-03-05

### Fixed
- ask_user input visibility: switched from raw `input()` to Rich `Prompt.ask` so typed text is visible
- Batch edit review: added "Accept all, don't ask again" option to disable review for the session

## [3.3.1] - 2026-03-03

### Fixed
- Qwen model list: removed duplicates, removed models not in Coding Plan (qwq-plus, qwen3.5-flash, qwen-turbo, qwen-math-plus)
- Added missing Coding Plan models: glm-4.7, MiniMax-M2.5
- Model pull prompt: single-letter input no longer accidentally matches model names

### Added
- GitHub Pages landing page with particle animation, glassmorphism, animated counters
